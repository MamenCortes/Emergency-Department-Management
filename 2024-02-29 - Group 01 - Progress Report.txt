This week we expected to be able to do...
=========================================
We planned to complete steps 1 and 2, expecting to define the project's intent and a list of the system's features, write the user stories and the use cases, and develop a requirements table and a traceability matrix.

Reasons why

This week we did...
===================
We followed the plan and completed the first 2 steps.

Reasons why
